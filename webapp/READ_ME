the folder "assets" contain all static files for use. This defined in /website/webapp/webapp/settings.py at the bottom.


The folder "web_page", used here, holds the main html code under /website/webapp/web_page/templates.
Each page has a html file, and that total is "3" as of when this was written.
IT IS NESSESARY to modify views.py and urls.py to accommadate additional html files/pages.
"web_page" is a django app. More can be added on, but each new one made must be declared in setting.py under "INSTALLED_APPS"


Background color can be controlled in each file and more details in html link above.
Experiment to understand more things. Make backup of the project as needed.

Read the first link above to restart site server on console.
>>(The site must first be in enviroment (env), this is done in the main folder of app, --- website$ source env/bin/activate >>> will have (env) infront of path)<< This is no longer needed if files are created outside of an enviroment

The server must be turned on at webapp --- website/webapp$ python manage.py runserver
Ctrl-C will turn off server. Chnages can be made as server runs. Just refresh site.
